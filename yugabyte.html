                            I spent the course of my Summer 2020 internship at Yugabyte working on the redesign of aspects of the website. In particular, I worked on the News page, the Success Stories page, and the Platform page redesign. In doing
                            so, the goal was to update the site to reflect the new brand traits.

                            The pages on the Yugabyte website do not represent the product and the direction that the product is going in, and should do so while taking into account the Yugabyte Brand Traits.

                        The focus over the course of my internship was the News page, the Success Stories pages, and the Platform page. Those pages are key pages to update and highlight because
                        they play an important role in the projection of what Yugabyte is what what kind of product they offer to their customers, as well as the kinds of successes they have had.

                            I started each page redesign by looking at the existing page, identifying places where it could improve, and looking at the sites of competitors and other similar types of pages to see how
                            information could best be presented to maximize the use of space.

                            others are saying about Yugabyte. Additionally, there would be featured articles for specific news that would want to be highlighted.

                        scroll that emphasizes the "why" behind the customer's story with Yugabyte, to drive that point home. </p>

                            I think this summer internship gave me a good opportunity to better understand client-related products, and how to approach design
                            from the perspective of think of current as well as potential future customers. While I think in a non-pandemic, non-remote internship, perhaps the
                            way the thought process behind these designs might have changed, I believe it was also a good example and practice of my communication and capacity to work with others.
