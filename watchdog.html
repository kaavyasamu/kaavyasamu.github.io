                        <p>
                            For our group project for Pervasive Interaction Design, we decided to create a security device that would assist
                            people by keeping track of their belongings when they need to step away.

                            While working or studying in public places, individuals often are concerned about the safety of their belongings, or cut short or tailor their work schedule around their lack of desire to either ask others to watch their belongings or leave them unattended.

                    <p class="back-info">
                        When people are working or studying in a public place like a library or cafe, and have to get up to use the bathroom or get something to drink, they have a few options: leave their stuff unattended (and risk items being stolen), ask a stranger to watch the items (with no guarantee they will do so), or pack everything up and take it and go, with the possibility of losing the seat once they return.
                    <br> <br>
                    Our goal was to create a product that would give the user the ability to protect their belongings should they want to get up and walk away.</p>

                    <p class="back-info">
                        We conducted diary studies with 6 participants and two separate rounds of interviews. The first round was with 7 participants and the second round had 6 participants. For the diary studies and first round of interviews, we spoke with college students of both undergraduate and graduate levels. For the second round of interviews, we widened our audience scope in order to gain a more comprehensive view of our original problem. The goal behind this formative study was to understand how people work and study in public spaces such as coffee shops and libraries. Our participants included remote workers, mothers, librarians, baristas, and media center employees. Due to COVID-19, the diary studies were conducted via email and the interviews via phone and virtual conferencing software.
                        <br><br> When a user is working or studying in a public space and need to get up, three main behaviors are seen:
                        <br> - Ask a stranger to watch their stuff while they are gone
                        <br> - Pack up all of their belongings and bring it with them (may return, may not)
                        <br> - Only study with friends who they trust to watch their stuff
                    </p>

                        <p class="back-info">The WatchDog keychain itself will detect the motion of the items that are paired to it. On the mobile app, the user can determine what alarm noise they want, how loud they want it to be. They can also decide whether they want the WatchDog to sound an alarm in that environment, or manually control the alarm themselves from their phone, or just an alarm notification or noise sent to the userâ€™s phone. The WatchDog can then sound an alarm to notify the area that there is something happening. The alarm can be disabled by a fingerprint sensor on the WatchDog keychain. If the user does not want to sound an alarm, they can set up the option to just receive a notification that the WatchDog has detected motion around their belongings.

                            With the WatchDog device and the companion mobile application, users can track their belongings. Once the belongings are paired to the device, they can identify where their items are on a map in order to locate them. This can benefit the user if the items are stolen or if they lose or leave them somewhere.

                        <p class="back-info">users can preset and save settings for different locations so that rather than having to set up their WatchDog every time they go somewhere, they can rely on saved settings. In doing so, they can quickly tap on one of those settings and have the WatchDog adjust the alarm sound, noise level, and protection range. When the WatchDog identifies that their belongings have moved, they will recieve a notification according to how they have set up their security preferences (whether it is just a notification, an alarm coming from the WatchDog device that they control, or an alarm on their mobile phone).</p>

                            Given that this was a course limited in time (as well as one that was remote due external factors), it was a challenge to create a product whose use would be more prevalent in the pre-pandemic scenario and especially for locations such as libraries and cafeterias.Â  Due to the pandemic, a lot of general user behaviors have changed, especially in public places. One of them is towards personal security. Unlike the pre-pandemic era, people are not so comfortable going to crowded places or asking a stranger to watch their stuff when away. This creates a huge opportunity for our product to create an impact in the time that lies ahead of us.
