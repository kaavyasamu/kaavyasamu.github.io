                            Pulse is a two part solution (an Apple Watch app and an iPhone app), that recognizes the symptoms of an anxiety attack to address and assist people during and after anxiety attacks.

                            Those who suffer from anxiety attacks have a hard time finding technology to help deal with anxiety attacks when each anxiety attack can require different coping mechanisms.

                        To some people, having anxiety attacks is a daily life challenge, and while there are solutions available to help, there are often drawbacks to each one that causes them to be on the continuous search for something new.
                    </p>
                    <p class="back-info">
                        While we can try to design for as many types of anxiety attacks as possible, itâ€™s impossible to fully plan for every single nuanced experience. However, the ability to provide as much of assistance to those who deal with anxiety attacks as possible was very important for us. As I did research and learned from comments after presenting in class, I became aware that there is much more research and ideation that can be when designing in this problem space.

                    <p class="back-info">
                        One of the biggest takeaways from user research is that users wanted to be able to pause and end the features of the app at their own pace, rather than a set time. They also wanted the ability to switch between the features of the app after it automatically opens to their preferred setting. Through feedback, we decided that each feature of the Apple Watch app contains an emergency call button, which can also be set on the app itself to call whomever the user selects; a family member, a friend, or a helpline.

                            <p class="back-info">The main features to incorporate from user interviews were haptic feedback (physical pulses), auditory feedack (sounds), meditative feedback (breathing exercises), and visual feedback (visual games). With each feature comes an emergency call option, with the option to swipe to end or pause the use of the app at any time.</p>

                            I think this project was very critical in helping us understand how to design for people who have anxiety and anxiety attacks. I think what we perhaps did not realize and therefore found it hard to design
                            for is just how varied any anxiety or panic attack can be. There is no "one size fits all" tool to help someone when they are having an anxiety attack, just like there is no "one size fits all" user to design for.
                            However, in saying that, I think we attempted to address that challenge by offering a lot of options for the user as well as the ability to control those choices at their own pace, so that they can maintain control over how they choose to use the product.
