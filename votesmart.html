                            VoteSmart is a mobile app that keeps users up to date on the day-to-day political occurrences as well as the ballot during an election year.

                    <p class="back-info">
                        U.S. elections have a history of a low voter turnout. Even in major presidential elections, voter turnout has been at 60% of the eligible voters. Reasons that people do not vote can range from their lack of knowledge about what is on the ballot for the election to just not being interested or invested in politics.
                    <br> <br>
                    The goal of VoteSmart is to increase the number of voters who participate in U.S. elections. By encouraging users to stay up to date with politics between elections, they can feel more incentivized to vote on issues and candidates that they have learned about or have an interest in.</p>

                    <p class="back-info">
                        From my user research and competitive analysis, I learned just how wide the scope of this topic is. With a topic such as voter education and awareness, there is so much information that could be covered, like voting day information, polling information, community reactions and opinions regarding bills and representatives, among other things. However, users stressed the importance of making sure that the features were not overwhelming. They wanted the option of being able to use features at some point, even if they may not use it all the time. I chose to focus on what interviewees wanted to see the most - non-partisan, accurate information that would allow them to keep an eye on what was going on in politics so they can use that information to aid them in making their choices during an election.

To learn more about specific bills, users can not only read a summary, but how representatives have voted on them. They can, if they want, read the full text of the bill. Each of the bills are tagged by the topics of relevance, through which users can see bills that are similarly tagged.

                            Reflecting on this project, what I think was difficult to understand was just how broad of a problem
                            was trying to be solved. Things that were also brought up through interviews were desires to increase
                            voter registration, finding polling stations, and other things more relating to elections. There are many directions
                            in which to take a topic such as politics and voter education and engagement. People are also selective about the kinds
                            things they are looking for, so even trying to cover a range of topics means that some users would not use all of the features of the app.
