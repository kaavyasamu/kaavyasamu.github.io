                            “How might we simplify and strengthen the resources for
                            female journalists to deal with ongoing online harassment?"                        </p>

                    <p class="back-info">
                        Numerous studies have demonstrated that women and nonbinary journalists are far more affected by online harassment than their male counterparts. Often, this harassment includes threats of sexual violence. Naturally, this has created a hostile environment for female journalists in an industry that is already dominated by men. Bearing the brunt of online harassment has serious consequences for these women. Several studies have shown that female journalists, “experience depression and anxiety, avoid engaging with readers, reporting on certain topics, or say they consider leaving journalism altogether,” as the result of this incessant abuse.                    <br> <br>
                        The harassing messages can be overwhelming, emotionally taxing, and even dangerous. It’s not surprising, then, that nearly a third of women journalists dealing with this harassment consider leaving the profession altogether. We saw a serious problem here and decided to see how we might address it. We heard from female journalists themselves to understand what they want most out of a support tool.                </div>

                    <p class="back-info">
                        We began our research and data gathering portion of our project with the people that understand this problem the best: women researchers working to help female journalists confront this issue, and female journalists themselves.
                        What we found was an agreement that social media companies do little to mitigate the harassment that female journalists face online. The harassment is based on gender, but also race, occuring not only in the United States but internationally. The implications of the harassment that female journalists face
                    can and are life threatening. From our interviews, we learned that there are three ways in which we can think about this problem space; educating female journalists on online safety, helping reduce the trauma that they face online, and providing protection to the female journalists.                   </p>

                    <p class="back-info">
                        The next stage of our data-gathering included a comparative analysis of existing resources for female journalists facing online harassment. Our goal was to both find inspiration in existing resources and, more importantly, to identify areas for improvement. The existing resources that we identified include JSafe, PEN America’s Online Harassment Field Manual, Troll Busters, Safe Sisters and Vita-Activa.
                        What we found were that across the competitors, there was a lack of accountability for those resources to provide the user updates on what was happening regarding any information that the user reports to them. There was a lot of beneficial information in each resource, but was overwhelming, and difficult to navigate.

                            Through Vici, users can log cases of online harassment that they face on a variety of platforms. When they do so, they submit the platform on which it occurred, the type
                            of threat that it is (defined by the Twitter Rules and Policies5), how safe or unsafe the user feels, what tactics are being used to harass the user, any keyword tags the user wants to use to add to the report, and screenshots of the harassment itself.
                            Users can view all of the logs of harassment they have submitted on Vici to track their online threats. The log shows the history of what they have logged as well as the type of threat it has been logged as, what platform it is from, and tracking the progress of Vici processing the log. By processing the submission of the online threat, Vici will evaluate the risk level that the online threat poses and recommend resources based on that.
                            When the log of the report is expanded, the user is shown tailored resources based on the specific online threat they have logged. Based on how high the risk is and the content of the harassment itself, Vici will offer recommendations that might be useful for the user in terms of mental and emotional health resources, and if legal resources might be useful, what kinds of options the user has.

                            I think that the harassment that female journalists face was clearly shown to us to be a very important, albeit big problem. While it may not be possible to tackle every aspect,
                            we did our best based off of the numerous interviews that we had to design features that would be beneficial for those who are our target user group. We thought we could benefit from more data, gathered from a large number of female journalists in order to
                            improve or change the trajectory of our prototype. I think that a challenge that we faced was trying to encompass all of the ways that we wanted to provide help, but doing so in a way that was not overwhelming. As we finished the project, we agreed that with more time
                            and more interviews and data, we would be able to understand what kind of path this project would take and how it would shape.
