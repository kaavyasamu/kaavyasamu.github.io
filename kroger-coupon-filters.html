                        The most used feature of the Kroger app as well as the other banners is the coupons feature. In fact, the coupon feature is used almost twice as much as the next popular feature.
                        <br> <br>
                        Before we started ideating, we looked at the existing interface that was on the app before engaging with the Google Sprint process. We noticed that the filtering system was difficult, and also wanted to tackle the layout of the coupon landing page.

                    <p class="back-info">
                        Through our research, we discovered that the users of the Kroger app have to navigate through many categories when trying to filter the available coupons. This also meant that users were unable to clearly see what they were filtering by or quickly find categories to filter by. We also saw that there was a lot of types of filtering options provided that customers may not necessarily want to see. The oversaturation of information also meant that the users were unable to be efficient in their use of the coupon feature, which added to complaints that we saw. Because of the high usage of the coupon feature and the level of feedback we saw, we kept this in consideration.

                        <p class="back-info">Because we worked on this feature during a 2 week sprint, our team decided to work on a section of the coupon feature of the app. When sketching, we begun with the filter page itself, because we thought that would require the most thought and had the most potential for change.</p>

                            Looking back on this sprint, I think there was a lot of ambition in what we wanted to take on. Obviously, not everything could be implemented, so in retrospect I think it would have been smarter to work on
                            focusing in on the features that we knew could have been developed and testing those. However, it did give us as a team a good insight into how people not only want to use this feature of the app, but other features as well.
